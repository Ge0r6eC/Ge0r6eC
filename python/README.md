# Dev playgrounds
This repo contains dev container setups for introductory concepts.
### Getting Started
cd into the playground of your choice and type
```bash
code .
```
Once the window opens a pop up in the bottom corner will invite you to open in container, please accept.
If you miss the pop up use ctrl+shft+p and start typing `open in container` this should give you the same
option.
Enjoy...
